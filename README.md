# 📊 Loan Approval Dashboard – Excel Project (BFSI Domain)
This is a self-built Excel dashboard project based on a real-world dataset used in BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) domain. It demonstrates my Excel data analysis skills including data cleaning, pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and interactive dashboard creation.

# 📁 Files Included
- `Loan Approval Analysis Dashboard – BFSI Domain.xlsx` – My main project file (cleaned data, pivot tables, dashboard)
- `Loan Prediction Dataset - RAW.csv` – Raw dataset (downloaded from open-source BFSI loan prediction project)

# 🛠️ Tools & Features Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts (3D Column, Stacked Column, Bar Chart)
- Slicers (Gender, Property Area, Education, Self Employed)
- Dashboard Sheet

# ✅ Project Steps
1. Cleaned raw data (handled missing values, standardized columns)
2. Created pivot tables to analyze:
   - Loan status by gender
   - Loan status percentage by area
   - Average applicant income by loan status
3. Designed interactive charts using pivot charts
4. Linked slicers across all visuals for interactivity
5. Finalized a dashboard that simulates real-world loan data analysis

# 🔍 Key Insights
- Males applied for loans more than females, but approval rates were fairly balanced.
- Semiurban areas had the highest loan approval rates.
- Graduates had slightly higher chances of loan approval.
- Applicant income did not heavily affect approval status, as average income remained close across approved and rejected cases.

# 📌 Domain Relevance
This type of analysis is commonly performed by data analysts in Indian IT companies working for BFSI clients. It reflects how analysts deliver insights to business teams using real-world loan applicant data.
